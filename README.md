# PaintCeunah

PaintCeunah is a Windows application developed to provide a painting tool similar to Microsoft Paint. It offers a variety of drawing tools and features to create digital artwork easily.

## Features

- **Drawing Tools**: Includes freehand drawing, shapes (circle, square, rectangle, line), and pencil.
- **Color Selection**: Choose fill and stroke colors using a color picker.
- **Shape Customization**: Customize shapes with different fill and stroke colors, and adjust border widths.
- **Export to Image**: Export drawings as image files (e.g., JPEG, PNG) for sharing or use in other applications.
 
## Shape Properties
After drawing a shape, you may want to adjust its position, angle, or scale. You can use the menu above the screen to make these changes.
- **Rotation**: This adjusts the angle of the shape clockwise around its midpoint. For example, rotating it 30 degrees to the right.
- **Translation**: This moves the shape based on the X and Y coordinates you input.
- **Scaling**: Scales the shape around its midpoint. The minimum scale factor is 1, ensuring the shape remains centered without shifting its position.

## Usage

1. **Color Selection**: Before starting drawing, select the fill and stroke colors by clicking on the respective color boxes and choosing the desired colors from the color picker.

2. **Drawing Shapes**:
   - **Circle**: Click the left mouse button to draw a circle. Hold down the right mouse button to draw an ellipse.

   - **Translation**: Input X or Y values to move the shape. Entering 0 resets the position to its original starting point.
   - **Scaling**:  Scale the shape, ensuring the proportions are maintained. Note that the stroke size will also increase accordingly.
